<!--Third paragraph's text--><h3>The end score of both - the Pixel Rocket Project team, and the computer itself are listed on the table below. Both sides were challenged to score the highest out of six draws during four matches of 
    each round. Whichever side won the most after the end of the 4 matches was the victor of each round. Whoever earned the most victories out of all the rounds in the end was the victory. Despite the team's best efforts
    unforunately for them the computer ended up being the victor. Ah, a classic tale of the results of adaptive techonlogy...  Better luck next time!
